# Dart Scoreboard Mobile

## Motivation

This is a remake of my first ever React/Node.js application.

## Description

\***\*Highly would NOT recommend\*\*** viewing this project from a desktop device. Primarily created for a native environment (Android), this particular remake is being geared towards serving over a web based provider for iOS users. Once all main functionality is restored, the underlying storage functionality will be migrated to AWS Amplify (was previously SQLite prior to browser relaunch).
